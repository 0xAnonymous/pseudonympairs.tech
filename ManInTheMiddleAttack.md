The best defense against man in the middle attacks might be the following. Think of it as an "authentication ritual" or "handshake". The pair agrees on a random number with a commit-reveal scheme, and also commits public keys during the commit phase. They reveal their numbers, and should both get the same random number. The credentials exchanged can be proven honest by validating that both people in the pair got the same number. This can be validated in many different ways. The probability of the man in the middle attacking this in a way that both peers get the same number is 1/numberSize, and, the attacker still has no control over _what_ number is generated (but can technically exchange false credentials while making it seem like honest credentials were exchanged. )

Then, one way to verify that the peers got the same number (there are many other ways to do this too) is to use the random number to agree to "pre-meet" on a time _before_ the event. It is only possible for both people to actually show up on that time, if they were able to exchange information without any tampering, and if they could exchange that information, they can use the keys they exchanged to set up a secure channel. This defense is as "Turing safe" (same difficulty for breaking Turing test) as the actual event itself.
